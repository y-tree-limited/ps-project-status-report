How to Update the Project Status Report
This dashboard is a self-contained HTML file. You do not need to be a developer to update it. All changes—including adding new tasks and saving the file—are done directly in your browser.

1. Editing Text & Statuses
Edit Text: Click anywhere on the page (titles, dates, descriptions, task names) and simply type. It works just like a Word document.

Cycle Colors:

Status Pills: Click any status (e.g., "IN PROGRESS", "TO DO") to cycle through colors (Red/Amber/Green/Blue/Gray).

Project Status (Top Right): Click the main status pill to cycle the overall project health.

Timeline Rows: Click the status text on the right side of a timeline bar to change the color of that specific row.

Section Headers: Click specific headers (like "Current Blocker") to change the accent color of the card border.

2. Updating the Timeline
Resize Bars: Drag the slider circle on any timeline bar left or right to adjust the percentage.

Change Status: Click the text to the right of the bar (e.g., "Not started") to cycle the color theme for that row.

3. Adding & Removing Items
You no longer need to edit the code to add or remove rows.

Add New Items: Look for the + Add ... buttons at the bottom of every section (e.g., + Add Task, + Add Timeline Item, + Add New Section).

Delete Items:

Tasks & Rows: Click the Trash Can icon (🗑️) on the far right of any row to delete it.

Sections: Click the Trash Can icon in the top-right corner of any white card to remove the entire section.

4. Saving Your Changes (Important!)
Because this runs in a browser, "File > Save" often tries to save the whole webpage structure rather than your changes.

Do NOT use Ctrl+S or "Save As" in the browser menu.

Instead: Click the black "Download Updated Report" button at the top right of the page.

This will automatically generate and download a new HTML file with today's date in the filename (e.g., Project_Status_Report_2026-01-14.html).

Next time: Open this new file to continue working.
